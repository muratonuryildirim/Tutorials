By performing iterative pruning and network re-training, PackNet is able to sequentially “pack” multiple tasks into a single network while ensuring minimal drop in performance and minimal storage overhead. To do that, after finding $n$<sup>th</sup> pack, it freezes and removes that \"pack\" from the large backbone. Hence, $n+1$<sup>th</sup> pack that will be constructed for the next task will not interfere the $n$<sup>th</sup> pack and it repeats same steps for the rest of the tasks to avoid catastrophic forgetting. In the figure, white circles represents available neurons in the backbone while bold circles indicates neurons that are already occupied in another pack that is why in the next pack selection these neurons will be discarded.\n",
