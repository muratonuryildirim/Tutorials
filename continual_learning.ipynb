        "\n",
        "According to the traditional machine learning approach, it is assumed that data is already and always available. Hence, the model could work nicely if it is trained by the data on-hand. Recently, scientists and researchers realize that it is not the case. They, unfortunately, found that artificial neural networks have a tendency to forget. They even illustrated that the networks forget previously learned information completely and abruptly upon learning new information which is called **catastrophic forgetting**.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the trained model is faced with an unfamiliar observation or task, it could confuse and lead to wrong answers. Therefore, it has been suggested that this static approach should be replaced with the more dynamic one so that machine learning models can adapt themselves to the new tasks or experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Continual Learning is the concept to learn a model for a large number of tasks sequentially without forgetting knowledge obtained from the preceding tasks, where the data in the old tasks are not available anymore during the training of the new ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tasks should have the following criteria to be continuous:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Data (and tasks) become available only during the time.\n",
        "* No access to previously encountered data.\n",
        "* Constant computational and memory resources (efficiency)\n",
        "* Incremental development of ever more complex knowledge and skills (scalability)\n",
        "\n",
        "There are other also other approaches that should not be confused with the continual learning to make the machine learning systems more dynamic and adaptive:\n",
